## Introduction

This project analyzes a dataset of hardware synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines. It aims to uncover trends and patterns in electronic music instrument design and evolution over the years. The dataset excludes modular systems such as Eurorack, Buchla modules, FracRack, and 4U formats, focusing instead on standalone devices.

The data has been compiled through a mix of automated and manual processes, combined with extensive research. It is intended to be a valuable resource for researchers, musicians, and enthusiasts interested in exploring trends, patterns, and the history of synthesizers. The dataset is a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new releases and additional features.

By exploring key attributes like synthesis types, polyphony, and production time, this project hopes to shed light on the technological advancements in music hardware.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on exploring relationships between key features, including synthesis type, polyphony, and production trends. For example, a correlation heatmap visualizes the interaction between these features to identify significant trends in hardware synthesizer design.

Visualizations also explore how the number of oscillators and the duration of production vary over time, offering insights into the evolving landscape of electronic music instruments.

## Custom Metrics

A custom metric evaluating the "Fame" or "Influence" of a synthesizer has been developed. This metric accounts for factors such as:
- Production duration
- Popularity within music production communities
- Historical significance

The metric is designed to help identify the most impactful synthesizers in music history, based on qualitative and quantitative data.

## Usage

To explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks to analyze the dataset.

The notebooks guide you through visualizing trends and conducting analyses on the evolution of hardware synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines.
